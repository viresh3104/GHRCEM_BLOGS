              Gemini vs ChatGPT – which generative AI chatbot should you use to answer questions, create content, design
              code, and more? Ultimately, there’s no easy answer. Comparing Gen AI bots isn’t easy, particularly as
              leading vendors frequently update their models.For instance, in December 2024, Google announced the
              release of Gemini 2.0—the most capable model it’screated so far (although companies always seem to say
              that). Similarly, ChatGPT introduced the world to a new set of advanced reasoning models (the o1 models),
              available within ChatGPT, specially designed for “deep thinking” tasks.We can spend all day discussing how
              each company’s different models work. But for this particular comparison, we’re going to focus on the
              central “chatbot” experience.
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="lower">
          <h3>Gemini vs ChatGPT: The Core Similarities</h3>
          <ul>
            <li> Multimodal capabilities: Both Gemini and ChatGPT are powered by multimodal AI models. They can process
              text, images, and audio. However, Gemini has “image output” as an option on the free plan, while you need
              a paid plan for this with ChatGPT.</li>
            <li>
              Web access: Both apps can search the web for real-time data to inform responses. However, Google Gemini is
              powered by Google Search, while ChatGPT uses Bing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Data management: With each chatbot, users can turn memories on or off, delete conversations, and have
              “temporary” chats. However, ChatGPT does allow you to archive conversations, whereas Gemini doesn’t.
              Device support: Both ChatGPT and Gemini are available on mobile and web apps. Notably, though, ChatGPT
              does offer a desktop app, too.
            </li>

          </ul>

          <h3>The Models Powering the Bots</h3>
          One other thing both Gemini and ChatGPT have in common is they’re both powered by multimodal AI models.
          ChatGPT is currently using two families of models: The GPT-4o collection, and the newer o1 family of reasoning
          models. Google Gemini is powered by the “Gemini” models, such as Gemini Flash 1.5, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and now
          Gemini 2.0 Flash (in testing). Each model collection has its own distinct strengths and weaknesses. ChatGPT,
          for instance, has a much smaller “context window” (128k tokens) than Gemini (over 2 million). This means it
          can recall information for longer. However, OpenAI’s o1 model excels at logical thinking, thanks to
          chain-of-thought reasoning that allows it to analyze complex problems. <br>

          Gemini 2.0 is better at offering companies and developers the tools they need to create “autonomous agents”,
          although you can create custom bots with ChatGPT. Both tools also support both text and image generation.
          However, ChatGPT uses DALL-E 3 (a slightly more mature model), while Google relies on Imagen 3 – it’s new
          text-to-image generator. Both apps also have a memory bank, although these banks work a little differently.
          ChatGPT has its memory turned on by default for paid users, and collects information about you to tailor
          responses. With Gemini, you “add memories” to your settings manually.

          <h3>Custom Chatbot / Agent Creation </h3>
          In the past, Google fell behind ChatGPT in terms of “chatbot creation” options. OpenAI allows Plus,
          Enterprise, and Pro users to create custom chatbots in minutes. There are no limits to how many GPTs you can
          build, and all you need to do is tell the builder (in English) what you want to create.

          These custom GPTs can generate images with DALL-E 3, run code, and browse the web. You can also customize them
          with knowledge files. For custom GPTs, Google previously only offered “Gemini Gems”, to Advanced, Business,
          and Enterprise users. The solution is similar to the OpenAI GPT builder, and allows you to create bots with
          natural language. However, you can’t use Gems to generate AI images. <br>

          What gives Google a slight edge over OpenAI now, is that it’s giving companies more ways to create autonomous
          agents. While OpenAI is experimenting with agentic AI, Google is actively giving developers access to a range
          of tools for building autonomous agents within Vertex AI.

          Users can now experiment with Gemini 2.0 Flash (Experimental) to create agents capable of completing various
          tasks in sequence. These agents can understand multimodal inputs, and generate content in different formats
          too. Google has already introduced some of the potential of autonomous AI within its platform with Project
          Mariner

          <h3>Gemini vs ChatGPT: Which is Better</h3>
          So, based on all of these findings, which chatbot is better for businesses? Ultimately, it all depends on what
          you need. If you’re looking for an intuitive chatbot that gives you more control over security, and access to
          advanced reasoning models, and coding capabilities, ChatGPT might be the better choice. I think ChatGPT is
          better for coding, content creation (in general), and security.

          Gemini, on the other hand, is definitely the better option for people who already use Google products, like
          Workspace and Gmail, since it integrates deeply with these apps. It’s also the better solution for custom
          chatbot or agent creation – thanks to the rise of Gemini 2.0.

          My advice? Test the free versions of both bots and make your decision from there.

            <h1>Google's $75 billion LLM</h1>
            <h6>
              ● Viresh Navtake&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published
              On 12.50AM 31st Jan
            </h6>
            <div class="description">
              Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai,
              Google parent Alphabet plans to invest around $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, chief executive
              Sundar Pichai said, as the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race intensifies among tech giants.

              This investment follows similar announcements by Microsoft, which plans to invest $80 billion in AI
              infrastructure in 2025, and Facebook parent Meta, which plans to invest between $60 billion to $65 billion
              in capital expenditure to boost its AI efforts this year.

              "Our results show the power of our differentiated full-stack approach to AI innovation and the continued
              strength of our core businesses. We are confident about the opportunities ahead...We are building,
              testing, and launching products and models faster than ever, and making significant progress in compute
              and driving efficiencies" Pichai said on February 4, after Alphabet reported its fourth-quarter results.
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="lower">
          <h3>Where will the investment go?</h3>

          During the company's earnings conference call, Alphabet CFO Anat Ashkenazi stated that the investment will be
          made towards building out technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers and
          networking. In the first quarter, Alphabet plans to invest about $16 billion - $18 billion towards these
          initiatives, she said. </br>
          These moves come despite the sudden emergence of Chinese AI lab DeepSeek which claims
          to have built AI models that can rival top-tier models from US companies such as OpenAI, Meta, and Google at a
          fraction of the cost, causing fresh concerns among investors over the billions of dollars being poured in by
          tech companies to develop their AI models and products.

          In the earnings call, Pichai praised DeepSeek saying it is a "tremendous team" and they have done "good work".
          However, he also argued that the search giant's Gemini Flash 2.0 and Flash Thinking 2.0 models are "some of
          the most efficient models" out there, including compared to DeepSeek's V3 and R1.

          "A lot of it is our strength of the full stack development into an optimization, our obsession with cost per
          query ... sets us up well for the workloads ahead, both to serve billions of users across our products and on
          the cloud side" he said.

          Pichai also argued that the proportion of the spend towards inference compared to training has been
          increasing. "I think the reasoning models accelerates that trend because it's obviously scaling upon inference
          dimension as well," he said.

          "We have a unique advantage because we develop every component of our technology stack, including hardware,
          compilers, models and products. This approach allows us to drive efficiencies at every level, from training
          and serving, to developer productivity" Pichai added. <br>

          In December, Google unveiled a flurry of new AI-related product launches and feature enhancements across its
          services, spanning Search, YouTube, Cloud, Android, and Pixel among others.

          This includes a new version of its flagship AI model, Gemini 2.0, aimed at powering the next generation of
          virtual agents; an experimental reasoning model Gemini Flash Thinking; video generation model Veo 2; a new
          quantum chip called Willow; and an enterprise version of its viral AI note-taking and research app NotebookLM.

          Google also announced Android XR, a mixed-reality operating system for headsets and smart glasses with
          built-in Gemini that is expected to debut in 2025 with Samsung's Project Moohan headset. <br>

          <h3> Financial performance </h3>
          Google however saw a slowdown in the revenues from its Cloud unit for the quarter.

          Google Cloud reported $12 billion revenue in the fourth quarter, up 30.1 percent from the same period last
          year, led by growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across core GCP products, AI Infrastructure, and Generative
          AI Solutions.

          However, it fell short of analyst expectations who were anticipating a higher growth amid the ongoing AI boom.
          The unit had reported a 35 percent revenue in the September-ended quarter.

          Google's advertising revenue rose 10.6 percent to $72.46 billion for the quarter. This includes Google's
          search revenues that increased 12.5 percent to $54.03 billion for the quarter and YouTube's ad revenues that
          grew 13.8 percent to $10.47 billion.

          Overall, Alphabet saw its revenue grow 12 percent year-on-year (YoY) to $96.5 billion. Net income increased 28
          percent YoY to $26.5 billion.
